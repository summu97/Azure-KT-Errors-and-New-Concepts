Kubernetes Reloader is an open-source tool (controller) that automatically reloads Kubernetes workloads (like Deployments, StatefulSets, DaemonSets) when ConfigMaps or Secrets they depend on are updated

Why is it useful?
- Normally, when you update a ConfigMap or Secret in Kubernetes, the changes do not automatically trigger a pod restart or reload of the application using those configs. This means the application might keep using the old configuration until you manually restart the pods.

Kubernetes Reloader solves this by watching for changes to ConfigMaps and Secrets, and then:
- Automatically triggering a rolling restart of the pods that reference those updated ConfigMaps or Secrets.
- This ensures your applications pick up configuration changes immediately without manual intervention.

How it works:
- You deploy the Reloader controller in your cluster.
- Annotate your Deployments/StatefulSets with specific annotations to tell Reloader which ConfigMaps or Secrets to watch.
- When a ConfigMap or Secret changes, Reloader updates pod template annotations (usually with a timestamp), triggering Kubernetes to rollout a restart of the pods.
